<h2>Discrete math</h2>
<p>We use math in computer science for a variety of reasons. For example, it's  pretty common for people to use mathematical notation to describe their ideas. Or, they might use math to show that something is true. In this series of notes, weâ€™ll talk about commonly used mathematical notation, concepts, and techniques.</p>

<p>HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the primary languages used to code websites. HTML defines the content of your website, CSS defines the appearance of your website, and Javascript makes the websites interactive and dynamic. These tutorials show how to write raw HTML/CSS/Javascript. However, there is much more to learn!</p>
