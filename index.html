<p>A collection of notes on computer science.</p>
<h2>Discrete math</h2>
<p>We use math in computer science for a variety of reasons. For example, it's  pretty common for people to use mathematical notation to describe their ideas. Or, they might use math to show that something is true. In this series of notes, weâ€™ll talk about commonly used mathematical notation, concepts, and techniques.</p>
