CSE 101
======

This is a Jekyll website using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). To add or edit notes, add or edit Markdown files in `notes`.

A couple of caveats:
* You need to add "front matter" to each Markdown file, defining the `title` and `layout` (see existing notes for examples).
* Backslashes in LaTeX code must be escaped. For example, in the `align` environment, you need to end each line with four backslashes instead of two.
