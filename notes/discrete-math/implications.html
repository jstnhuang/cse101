<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
<p><code>Implies</code> can be a difficult operator to understand. But, we will use it often. There are many different ways to say $A$ <code>implies</code> $B$ (notated $A \to B$):</p>

<ul>
  <li>$A$ <code>implies</code> $B$</li>
  <li>$B$ is implied by $A$</li>
  <li>$A \to B$</li>
  <li>If $A$, then $B$</li>
  <li>$B$ if $A$</li>
</ul>

<p>What it means for $A$ <code>implies</code> $B$ to be <code>true</code> is that if $A$ is <code>true</code>, then $B$ must also be <code>true</code>. If $A$ is <code>false</code>, then it doesn't matter what $B$ is -- $A$ <code>implies</code> $B$ will be <code>true</code>. Here it is in a truth table:</p>
{% include truth-table.html id="implies" vars="['A', 'B']" exprs="[new TTImplies('A', 'B')]" hiddenExprs="{}" %}

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Some examples may help clarify how this works.</p>

<h3>Number line</h3>
<p>Suppose $A$ = "$x > 5$" and $B$ = "$x > 0$". In this case, $A \to B$ = <code>true</code>, because whenever you have a number greater than 5, it must also be greater than 0.</p>

<p>Now suppose $A$ = "$x > -5$" and $B$ = "$x > 0$". Does $A$ imply $B$? No. If $x = -3$, then $A$ is <code>true</code>, but $B$ is <code>false</code>. So $A \to B$ is <code>false</code>. $A$ being <code>true</code> should guarantee that $B$ is <code>true</code>.</p>

<h3>Checking IDs</h3>
<p>Imagine being in a restaurant, and let $A$ = "The customer is drinking something alcoholic" and $B$ = "The customer is aged 21 or over." (This is a US-centric example, where the legal drinking age is 21.) You see four customers with drinks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>One is drinking a beer.</li>
  <li>One is drinking a soda.</li>
  <li>One is age 25.</li>
  <li>One is age 18.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whose drinks/IDs do you need to check to see if $A \to B$ = <code>true</code> for every customer? The answer is obvious, but let's check the truth table:</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr><th>$A$</th><th>$B$</th><th>$A \to B$</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Drinking beer</td><td>25 year old</td><td><code>true</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Drinking beer</td><td>18 year old</td><td><code>false</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Drinking soda</td><td>25 year old</td><td><code>true</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Drinking soda</td><td>18 year old</td><td><code>true</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see, $A \to B$ is <code>false</code> if the customer is drinking a beer and is 18, so you should check the customer drinking a beer, and the customer who's 18. Notice that if $A$ is <code>false</code> (the customer's drinking a soda), then $A \to B$ = <code>true</code> no matter what $B$ is. This is the case for all implications. If $A$ is <code>false</code>, then $A \to B$ is always <code>true</code>. But if $A$ is <code>true</code>, then $A \to B$ is only <code>true</code> if $B$ is <code>true</code> as well.</p>

<h2>Inverse, converse, and contrapositive</h2>
<p>There are special names for when you rearrange or negate $A$ and $B$. Given $A \to B$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\neg A \to \neg B$ is the inverse.</li>
  <li>$B \to A$ is the converse.</li>
  <li>$\neg B \to \neg A$ is the contrapositive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose your friend tells you, "if it's sunny tomorrow, then I'll go for a run." Let's also say that there are only two possibilities for the weather: sun or rain. Here are the inverse, converse, and contrapositive of that statement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inverse: "If it rains tomorrow, then I won't go for a run."</li>
  <li>Converse: "If I go for a run tomorrow, then it's sunny."</li>
  <li>Contrapositive: "If I don't go for a run tomorrow, then it rained."</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose your friend's statement is <code>true</code>. Here are three tough questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Must the inverse be <code>true</code>?</li>
  <li>Must the converse be <code>true</code>?</li>
  <li>And must the contrapositive be <code>true</code>?</li>
</ol>

<p>The answer is, surprisingly, that the contrapositive must be <code>true</code>, but neither the inverse nor the converse have to be <code>true</code>. In the next page of notes, we'll prove this. But, for now, let's think about it intuitively.</p>

<p>Suppose your friend is a star runner who runs on most days, rain or shine. Your friend told you that if it didn't rain tomorrow, she would go for a run. But she didn't tell you what she would do if it didn't rain. She could stay at home, or she could go for a run anyway, in which case the inverse is <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>The converse isn't guaranteed to be <code>true</code> for the same reason. Your friend could have gone for a run whether it was rainy or not.</p>

<p>Thinking about whether the contrapositive is always <code>true</code> is the hardest of them all. Either it was sunny or it rained.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If it was sunny outside, then your friend must have gone for a run.</li>
  <li>If it rained, your friend may have gone for a run, but also may not have.</li>
</ul>

<p>So as we can see, the only time your friend wouldn't have gone for a run is if it was rainy outside.</p>
  
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write out the truth table for $(\neg A) \lor B$. What do you notice? Can you explain why this makes sense?</p>
    {% include truth-table.html id="implies-formula" vars="['A', 'B']" exprs="[new TTNot('A'), new TTOr(new TTNot('A'), 'B')]" hiddenExprs="{1: true}" %}
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are four cards on a table. Each card has a side that's either red or blue, and a side with a number. Your friend tells you that if the card is red, then the other side must have an even number. The four cards you see are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Blue</li>
      <li>1</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Which cards do you need to flip over to see if your friend is right?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the inverse, the converse, and the contrapositive of "If a customer is drinking alcohol, he must be 21 or over"?
  </li>
</ul>
